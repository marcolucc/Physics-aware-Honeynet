# HoneyICS: A High-interaction Physics-aware Honeynet for Industrial Control Systems

This repository contains the source code and necessary files for the paper "HoneyICS: A High-interaction Physics-aware Honeynet for Industrial Control Systems".

## Abstract

Industrial control systems (ICSs) are vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks, i.e., security breaches in cyberspace that adversely affect the underline physical processes. In this context, honeypots are ideal countermeasures both to defend against such attacks and discover new attack strategies. In recent years, Honeypots for ICSs have made several progresses in trying to faithfully reproduce the behavior of OT networks, including physical process interactions. We propose a high-interaction, physics-aware, scalable, and extensible honeynet for ICSs, equipped with an advanced monitoring system. We deployed our honeynet on the Internet and conducted experiments to compare it with existing ICS honeypots.


## Contents

This repository contains the following directories:

- **PLCs**

    This directory contains the source code to build the software PLC that can be used in the honeynet. The PLCs' codes are implemented in ladder logic and are designed to simulate the behavior of real-world ICSs.

- **Proxy**

    This directory contains the source code for the proxy servers used in the honeynet. The proxies are responsible for forwarding traffic between the PLCs.

- **Matlab Simulink**

    This directory contains the source code for the Matlab Simulink models used in the honeynet and the Dockerfile to build the container. The models are used to simulate the physical processes controlled by the PLCs. To run it you will need an active Matlab License

 - **Attacks**

    This directory contains the attack files used in the experiments conducted in the paper. The directory is further divided into subdirectories for each attack. Each subdirectory contains the necessary files to execute the attack, including scripts, payloads, and configuration files.

## Overview

Within this repository, we have provided detailed instructions on how to successfully replicate our honeynet and execute the attacks outlined in our published article.

> While it is possible to install all necessary components on a singular machine, we highly recommend allocating the simulink container to a distinct device in order to circumvent any unforeseen issues arising from potential RAM depletion.

The honeynet comprises several components:  HMIs, PLCs, proxies, plant, management and  monitoring dashboards, and probes. Each element is containerized using Docker technology.

Specifically, the HMI component is built using ScadaBR, and its container is designed to automatically generate a view using a headless version of Selenium. Additionally, the HMI container connects to the PLCs using the entries plc1.net, plc2.net, and plc3.net, which may need to be modified to suit your specific configuration.

The PLC container, is built using  [OpenPLC](https://openplcproject.com/) and  [HoneyD](https://www.honeyd.org/) , with the use of  [HoneyPLC](https://github.com/sefcom/honeyplc) improvements. The PLCs are automatically loaded with the ladder logic for the use case illustrated below.

### Use case

![Alt text](readme/images/swat.png)
The use case, we considered is inspired by
[Lanotte et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10668), consisting of a network of three PLCs to control
(a simplified version of) the [iTrust Secure Water Treatment system](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7469060&tag=1) (SWaT).
For simplicity, we consider only three stages, with three tanks.

- Stage 1:

    -   Raw water is pumped into an 80-gallon tank T-201 via pump P-101.
    -   A valve MV-301 connects tank T-201 to a filtration unit that releases treated water into a second tank T-202 (with a capacity of 20 gallons).
    -   Water in T-202 flows into a reverse osmosis unit to reduce inorganic impurities.

- Stage 2:

    -   PLC-1 manages tank T-201 and controls the water level.
    -   PLC-2 manages tank T-202 and controls the valve opening/closing.
    -   The valve remains open when the tank is refilling and closed when it is emptying.
    -   If the water level in T-201 reaches its low setpoint, the pump is turned on and the valve is closed. If it reaches its high setpoint, the pump is turned off.

-  Stage 3:

    -   PLC-3 manages the backwash tank T-203 and controls the pump P-102.
    -   If the water level in T-203 reaches the low setpoint, the pump is turned off. If it reaches the high setpoint, the entire content of T-203 is pumped back into the filtration unit of T-202.

-  Additional: 
    - The HMI is used to visualize the status of the three tanks and their components.

### Network
The expected network outcome of the honeynet is illustrated in the following picture.

![Alt text](readme/images/network.png)

To ensure secure communication and prevent lateral movement, each PLC is situated on an individual network with a proxy serving as its default gateway. These proxies are strategically positioned in front of the PLCs, enabling bi-directional communication management. 

Moreover, the placement of probes directly on the proxy will facilitate the seamless capture of data transmitted to physical devices, providing scope for future enhancement.

## Setup

In each subdirectory where it is deemed necessary, comprehensive guidelines on utilizing each component of the honeynet can be found within the README.md file.

        ```

    3. Create the virtual networks for the PLCs:
        ```
        docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.3.0/24  --gateway=192.168.3.1 -o parent=ens224  plc1-macvlan-net

        docker exec -it plc1 ip route add default via 192.168.3.3 dev eth0

        docker exec -it plc2 ip route del default

        docker exec -it plc2 ip route add default via 192.168.4.3 dev eth0

        docker exec -it plc3 ip route del default

        docker exec -it plc3 ip route add default via 192.168.5.3 dev eth0

        docker exec -it proxy1 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to 192.168.2.2 
        # all the packets that go out of proxy1 will have its ip src address

        docker exec -it proxy2 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to 192.168.2.3

        docker exec -it proxy3 iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j SNAT --to 192.168.2.4
